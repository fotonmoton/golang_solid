// Openâ€“closed principle:
// "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"
// "You should be able to extend the behavior of a system without having to modify that system."
//
// Origin definitions:
// A module will be said to be open if it is still available for extension. For example, it should be possible to add fields to the data structures it contains, or new elements to the set of functions it performs.
// A module will be said to be closed if [it] is available for use by other modules. This assumes that the module has been given a well-defined, stable description (the interface in the sense of information hiding).
